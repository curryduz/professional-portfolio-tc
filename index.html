    <p>
 Hello, I'm Thomas<br> I would like to give you some insight in who I am in regard to my my education background, work experience and current projects that I have or had worked in the past and present. I'm an Austin native born and raised in Texas. I enjoy learning langugaes and problem solving in regard to anything that hasnt yet been fixed or has some type of solution needed in oreder to fix. I am a polyglot in which is a person who knows more than 3 langugaes. Those langugaes being Spanish, French, Portuguese and Mandarin. I have self-taught myself this languges through studying abroad and reading key information in order to comprend such diversity in culture and phonetics.<br>
 I am currently learning my 6th langugaes which is programming so I guess you say given the time that I have accomplished to conquer full stack developement i'd know about 10 to 12 langugaes. I enjoy helping others and I tend to give my all in doing so that others reach their goals. I also am I prior collegiate athlete who has play at Tarleton State University and Southeastern Oklahoma State University with a B.S degree in Behavioral Science and a Minor in Spanish. I am currently enrolled at Texas A&M University- Commerce as a M.A major in Applied Linguistics.
